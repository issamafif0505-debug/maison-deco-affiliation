        Hey! I'm {siteConfig.author.name}, and I started this site because I got tired of paying ridiculous contractor prices for things I could build myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been doing DIY woodworking for over 10 years. I've built sheds, decks, furniture, garden beds, and even a small cabin. Along the way, I've tried dozens of woodworking plan packages, programs, and guides — and most of them are garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is my honest take on the best DIY programs available. I only recommend things that actually deliver on their promises. Every product I list has been thoroughly researched, and I only feature programs with strong customer satisfaction and real money-back guarantees.
