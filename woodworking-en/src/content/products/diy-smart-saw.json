  "shortDescription": "Build your own CNC woodworking machine in a few hours. Create intricate designs, custom signs, and professional-quality woodwork — at the push of a button.",
  "fullDescription": "The DIY Smart Saw is for the woodworker who wants to take their craft to the next level. A CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine can carve intricate designs, cut perfect joints, and create custom signs with precision that no hand tool can match. The problem? Commercial CNC machines cost $3,000–$15,000. The DIY Smart Saw shows you how to build your own for a fraction of that cost — using parts you can find at any hardware store. The program includes step-by-step video instructions, a complete parts list, and software guides. Once built, you can use it to start a woodworking side business making custom signs, gifts, and furniture. With a $0.59 EPC (among the highest on ClickBank) and 75% commission, this converts particularly well with a maker/hobbyist audience.",
